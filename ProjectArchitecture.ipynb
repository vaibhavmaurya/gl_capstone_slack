    "## Overview\n",
    "For chat/communication, in this project [Slack](slack.com) is being used. There is a bot **gl-nlp-bot** in the slack channel which is used to answer the accident level for any incident reported by user.\n",
    "How this bot is implemented, detals are below.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project has two services. Both the services can be deployed in Kubernetes cluster. The respective docker files are avaialble in the repository to build the docker images.\n",

    "| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| `/slack/events` | Whenever there is a message in the channel **gl-capstone-nlp-bot**, this rest api is called by slack. Here the message from the channel is recieved, which is further processed and reply through the bot is prepared here. Bot in response sends back a form, where user has to input the details and click the Confirm button. This communication can be well understood in the below diagram of slack communication snapshot. |\n",
    "| `/slack/message-actions` | When user clicks the confirm button, the slack channel calls this rest api. Here in this endpoint, data from the user filled form is extracted and passed to **ML model endpoint /predict**. The ML model endpoint responds with the accident level, which is communicated back into the slack channel using bot **gl-nlp-bot** |\n",
